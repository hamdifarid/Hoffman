# Huffman using Python
Huffman code using python to calculate entropy, efficiency, codewords and length using probabilities 
This code can be used by engineering students. 
Students can easily calculate large huffman code problems in a matter of seconds saving their time.
I have also added and information and entropy calculator as a side code for those needing to calculate entropy using probability.
